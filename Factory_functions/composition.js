// composition vs inheritance
// Inheritance - when you design your objects around what they are;
// for example:

/*  
    Dog
        .poop()
        .bark()
    Cat
        .poop()
        .meow()
    * duplication we don't need that
    Animal 
        .poop()  
        
        Dog
            .bark()
        Cat
            .meow()
    
    Robot
        .drive()
        
        ClearningRobot
            .clean()
        murderRobot
            .kill()
    
    * what if we need a MurderRobotDog that can drive, kill and bark but cannot poop.
         * the above example would be screwed since we need 
          1) .drive() from Robot, 
          2) .kill() from murderRobot
          3) .bark() from Dog and no need for poop()
    * we end up in a banana gorilla problem where you request a banana, but you get a 
          gorilla holding a banana with the whole jungle ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£.
    
    * SOLUTION: make use of composition;
